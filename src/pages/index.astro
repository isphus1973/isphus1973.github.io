			<h1>ü¶π‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Welcome to my public notebook!</h1>
			<p>
				This blog is a personal space to record ideas, notes, experiments, questions, and discoveries I find interesting ‚Äî even if they're incomplete, wrong, or still in progress.
			</p>
			<p>
				The main goal is to serve as a reference repository for my "future self." Here you'll find posts about math, physics, programming, curiosities, open problems, and various reflections.
			</p>
			<p>
				Don't expect perfection: many texts are drafts, may contain conceptual errors or partial explanations. But for me, every entry has value ‚Äî whether to revisit, correct, or simply remember how I thought about a certain topic.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you landed here by chance, feel free to explore, disagree, suggest, or just get inspired. Just don't expect a definitive manual: this is a blog of living notes, always changing.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Posts on various topics, with no commitment to regularity or completeness</li>
				<li>Content frequently revisited, corrected, and expanded</li>
				<li>Focus on learning, memory, and personal record</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Thanks for visiting! If anything here helps, confuses, or inspires you, it was already worth it.
