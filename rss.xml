However, I have faced many situations in my work where I needed to deal with random variables. This has led me to become interested in the use of the Dirac delta function to model the distribution of a function of a set of random variables.</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jul 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
